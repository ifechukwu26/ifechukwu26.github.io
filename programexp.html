     <h5>MY PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCE!!!!</h5> 
      <div class="study_blog">
        <p>I cant really say that I have some kind of experience in programming but I have heard of it a little.</p>
        <p>My experience in programming started when my secondary school organized lessons with a professional computer institute, NIIT Nigeria. From the NIIT programme, I learnt the fundamentals of data processing, basic coding, and how to make and design websites, HTML, blogging sites.</p>
        <p>I also learnt the beginning of java and spreadsheet as well how to use the sketch up appbut it was all on the surface.</p>
