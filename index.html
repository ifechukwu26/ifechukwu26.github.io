           <p>Something that I have always been passionate about is helping people and the society. When I was younger, I never considered studying ICT as a course in university but I knew that I wanted to know a little about it. As time passed, we were made in Secondary school to offer extra-curricular activities like HTML, Sketch-up, Java, and Data processing. It was fun to learn things I never thought existed at that time. It opened my mind to ICT and the benefits that it can do in helping me achieve my passion and dream. </p>
           <p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) offers numerous benefits in supporting one's interest in social work and the medical field. I would like to create apps that raise awareness or have a specific purpose that aligns with my desires.</p>
